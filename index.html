                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to count objects in images is a fundamental skill that humans acquire effortlessly. In computer vision, counting objects remains a challenging problem, especially when the categories and scenes vary significantly. Traditional supervised methods often rely on large, annotated datasets and carefully tuned architectures to perform counting tasks. With the advent of large-scale vision-language models like CLIP, which aligns images and text in a shared embedding space, a new paradigm emerges: leveraging powerful pre-trained features to tackle tasks such as counting in a zero-shot or few-shot manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, we build upon OpenAI's CLIP model to perform object counting. We aim to answer the question: can we train a simple regression head on top of CLIP’s joint image-text embeddings to accurately count objects of a given category, and how does this approach compare to CLIP’s inherent zero-shot capabilities?
                </p>
                <h3>Key Contributions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilize CLIP’s pre-trained visual and textual encoders to extract embeddings for images and corresponding object class descriptions.</li>
                    <li>Train a neural network regressor to predict the count of the specified object from the combined image-text embedding.</li>
                    <li>Compare this learned model against a zero-shot CLIP baseline, where we select the most similar text prompt among multiple possible counts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Motivation:</h3>
                <p>
                    While CLIP excels at recognizing concepts and can sometimes estimate the presence or absence of objects, counting requires more granular numeric reasoning. By training a custom head on top of CLIP embeddings, we investigate whether CLIP’s strong representation space can be extended to handle counting tasks robustly.

            <p>
                Large vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, learn rich joint image-text representations, facilitating advances in numerous downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification and text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, existing VLMs exhibit a prominent well-documented limitation – they fail to encapsulate compositional concepts such as counting.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Teaching CLIP to Count to Ten** by Roni Paiss et al. explores this limitation by introducing a counting-aware CLIP model. They propose a counting-contrastive loss to finetune a pre-trained VLM, enabling it to distinguish between correct and counterfactual object counts in image-text pairs. Their work demonstrates significant improvements over original CLIP in object counting tasks while maintaining performance on general benchmarks.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Contrastive Vision-Language Models:** Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive success in vision and multimodal tasks. Models like CLIP and BASIC are trained with a contrastive objective, aligning matching text-image pairs closely while distancing non-matching pairs in the embedding space. However, these models struggle with tasks requiring precise numerical reasoning, such as counting.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Subitizing in Computer Vision:** Subitizing refers to the ability to instantly recognize the number of objects without counting. While humans can subitize up to a small number of objects (typically 4), VLMs like CLIP lack this capability, especially for larger numbers. Previous works have focused on limited object counts within subitizing ranges but have not addressed the broader counting problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Counting in Vision-Language Models:** Existing efforts to incorporate counting into VLMs have been confined to specific architectures like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our approach differs by enhancing general-purpose contrastive VLMs to include counting capabilities without being tied to specific tasks or domains.

        <!-- Methodology Section -->
        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is to enhance a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM), specifically CLIP, to perform object counting effectively. This involves leveraging both the image and text embeddings produced by CLIP and training an additional regression head to predict object counts.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Preprocessing and Embedding Extraction</h3>
            <p>
                We utilize the COCO dataset, which provides a rich set of images with detailed annotations, including object counts. The dataset is split into training and validation sets, ensuring a balanced distribution of object categories and counts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using CLIP’s pre-trained visual encoder, we extract image embeddings for all images in the dataset. Simultaneously, we generate text embeddings for object class descriptions, such as "a photo of three dogs," using CLIP’s text encoder.
            </p>
            <h3>Training the Regression Model</h3>
            <p>
                A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regression model is trained on top of the concatenated image and text embeddings to predict the count of objects. The training process involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Balancing the dataset to ensure equal representation across different object counts.</li>
                <li>Using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function to handle regression tasks effectively.</li>
                <li>Employing optimization techniques like Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling and early stopping to enhance training efficiency and prevent overfitting.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Comparative Analysis with Zero-Shot CLIP</h3>
            <p>
                To evaluate the effectiveness of the trained regression model, we compare its performance against CLIP’s inherent zero-shot capabilities. This involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using zero-shot CLIP to retrieve images based on count-specific text prompts.</li>
                <li>Assessing the accuracy of the regression model in predicting object counts compared to zero-shot predictions.</li>
                <li>Visualizing attention maps to understand the model’s focus during counting tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The results demonstrate that augmenting CLIP with a regression head significantly enhances its ability to count objects in images. This approach leverages the powerful joint embedding space of CLIP while introducing numerical reasoning capabilities essential for counting tasks.
