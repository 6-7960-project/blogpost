                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Counting objects of a specified type within images is a critical task in computer vision, applicable to domains such as surveillance, 
                    inventory management, and autonomous navigation. In this work, we leverage the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model 
                    to develop a streamlined and effective object counting framework. Our approach utilizes CLIP's pre-trained image and text embeddings 
                    to create a comprehensive feature representation, which is then fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained to predict 
                    object counts directly. Unlike traditional methods that depend on generating intermediate representations like heat maps or density 
                    estimations, our model operates entirely within the embedding space, simplifying the pipeline and reducing computational overhead. 
                    We train and evaluate our model on the COCO dataset, achieving competitive performance metrics in terms of Root Mean Squared Error 
                    (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and a Modified MAE (MMAE) designed to more effectively penalize off-by-one errors. Furthermore, 
                    we assess the model's generalization capabilities on the CountBench dataset, highlighting both its strengths and areas for improvement. 
                    By integrating residual connections and regularization techniques within the MLP architecture, we enhance the model's stability and 
                    generalization. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging CLIP's rich semantic embeddings provides a scalable and adaptable solution for object counting tasks.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Object counting within images is a fundamental task in computer vision, integral to applications such as surveillance, inventory 
                    management, and autonomous systems. Accurately determining the number of instances of specific object categories in diverse and 
                    complex scenes remains a challenging problem, particularly due to variations in object appearances, occlusions, and background clutter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional approaches to object counting often involve generating intermediate representations, such as density maps or heat maps, 
                    which estimate object locations and counts. While effective, these methods typically require extensive computational resources and 
                    large amounts of annotated data, limiting their scalability and applicability to real-world scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent developments, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated 
                    remarkable capabilities in understanding and relating visual and textual information through shared embedding spaces. CLIP's ability 
                    to encode images and textual descriptions into semantically meaningful vectors enables a new paradigm for object counting: leveraging pre-trained embeddings for direct count prediction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this work, we propose a model that builds upon CLIP's powerful embedding representations to perform object counting. Our approach 
                    involves concatenating CLIP's image and text embeddings to form a comprehensive feature vector, which is then input into a Multi-Layer 
                    Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained to predict the count of specified objects directly. This method simplifies the counting pipeline by 
                    eliminating the need for intermediate representations and capitalizes on CLIP's extensive pre-training on diverse image-text pairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we explore zero-shot counting capabilities by utilizing CLIP's text embeddings to handle object categories not seen during 
                    training. By designing our model to generalize across various object types without requiring explicit retraining, we aim to create a versatile 
                    and scalable counting solution. Our experiments on the COCO and CountBench datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating competitive performance and highlighting areas for future improvement.

                Large vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, learn rich joint image-text representations, facilitating advances in numerous downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification and text-to-image generation. 
                Nevertheless, existing VLMs exhibit a prominent well-documented limitation – they fail to encapsulate compositional concepts such as counting. Despite this, many other papers managed to improve CLIP's (or some other VLM's) counting capabilities, 
                however, all of the existing literature differs from our approach. We approach this problem as a regression task, and thus make our pipeline simpler, while still maintaing better accuracy over zero-shot.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Teaching CLIP to Count to Ten</strong> <sup><a href="#ref-paiss2023">[2]</a></sup> by Roni Paiss et al. explores this limitation by introducing a counting-aware CLIP model. 
                They propose a counting-contrastive loss to finetune a pre-trained VLM, enabling it to distinguish between correct and counterfactual object counts in image-text pairs. 
                Their work demonstrates significant improvements over original CLIP in object counting tasks while maintaining performance on general benchmarks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Zero-Shot Object Counting with Language-Vision Models</strong> <sup><a href="#ref-2309-13097">[3]</a></sup> This paper introduces Zero-Shot Object Counting (ZSC), a new setting where only a class name is known at test time, 
                eliminating the need for human-selected exemplars. Instead, the method automatically extracts exemplar patches from the input image itself. Using large vision-language models like CLIP and Stable Diffusion, 
                it identifies and selects patches that represent the target object class. A ranking model then picks the patches that minimize counting errors. 
                Experiments on the FSC-147 dataset demonstrate that this approach effectively counts objects without relying on manual annotations.

        <!-- Data Collection Section -->
        <section id="data_collection">
            <h2>Data Collection</h2>
            <p>
                For our data, we used the COCO 2017 train and validation set <sup><a href="#ref-paiss2023">[4]</a></sup>. COCO (Common Objects in Context) contains over 100,000 images of different objects in multiple settings. Objects range from everyday fruits to
                more abstract nouns like person as well as other random nouns like umbrella and toilet. It has annotations, so we were able to get data of the form (image, object, count). We additionally tested our model on the CountBench dataset <sup><a href="#ref-paiss2023">[2]</a></sup> (which has completely different objects than COCO) after modifying it. Namely, the CountBench dataset has data of the form 
                (image, caption, number) - so an example is a picture of headsets, with the caption being "We review the ten best gaming headsets in the market" and the number being 10 as there are 10 headsets. However, as stated, our model has the input of an image and the word
                description of an object, which is different than the caption. Thus for this, we modified the CountBench dataset, by using the OpenAI API and prompting ChatGPT-4 to summarize each caption to its most relevant word - because of this, we note that this dataset might be 
                faulty, and thus did not use it as the official validation dataset, but rather the val2017 from COCO.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Subset Selection and Balancing Counts</h3>
            <p>
                For training, we first thought of using every possible pair (image, object) where images are and objects are taken from train2017. However, as train2017 had 18GB of images, and there were 80 objects this was not viable. 
                Additionally, with this approach, a large majority of labels would then be zero, which would bias our model to predict zero. Thus, we opted for taking every pair (image, object) where the object was in the image and additionally added a fixed amount of (random)
                datapoints where the count was zero. With this approach, there was still quite a bit of class imbalance, so after a bit of testing we rebalanced our training data, as to not bias our model.

            <h2>Model and Method</h2>
            <p>
                Our model starts from the CLIP embeddings of the input image and the textual query. Given an input image and a corresponding query (e.g., "red cars"), we:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> <span>Use the CLIP image encoder to obtain an image embedding \( I \in \mathbb{R}^d \).</span> </li>
                <li> <span>Use the CLIP text encoder to obtain a text embedding \( T \in \mathbb{R}^d \).</span> </li>
                <li> <span>Concatenate these embeddings \( X = [I; T] \in \mathbb{R}^{2d} \).</span> </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We feed <span>X</span> into a customized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor. Our MLP uses five fully connected linear layers, including a skip connection inbetween them as well as batch normalization and drop out. After extensive testing, we
                arrived at this architecture - noting the following.
                <ul>
                    <li>Skip connection greatly improved our val accuracy noteably because we are doing a counting problem, so intuitively it makes sense as the model needs some form of "memory".</li>
                    <li>BatchNorm and Droput were used as to combat overfitting, as our model overfit on train very fast.</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Training and Evaluation Metrics Section -->
        <section id="training_evaluation">
            <h2>Training and Evaluation Metrics</h2>
            <h3>RMSE, MAE, and MMAE Definitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> Defined as <code>√(Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)^2 / N)</code>, where <code>y_i</code> is the ground-truth count and <code>ŷ_i</code> is the predicted count. RMSE heavily penalizes large errors and is sensitive to outliers. It is a common metric in regression tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>MAE:</strong> Defined as <code>Σ|y_i - ŷ_i| / N</code>, MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. It provides a more direct interpretation of the average magnitude of errors.</li>
                <li><strong>MMAE (Modified MAE):</strong> We propose a modified MAE given by <code>MMAE = Σ(|y_i - ŷ_i| / (y_i + 1)) / N</code>. MMAE weights the error by the scale of the count, penalizing off-by-one errors more heavily for smaller counts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why Train on MMAE?</h3>
            <p>
                For most counting tasks, an off-by-one error when the true count is small (e.g., 1) is more critical than the same error when the count is large (e.g., 54). By training directly on MMAE, we emphasize the importance of precision at low object counts, encouraging the model to be more careful and accurate when counts are small while still performing well in denser scenarios.
